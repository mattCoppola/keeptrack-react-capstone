## Project Description
This website is a basic tool for small businesses operating in the repair services industry.  The website is a repair order generator and basic inventory management system.  A user will be able to create an order, adding a summary of parts used for each repaired item on the order.  By adding parts to the order, once saved, it will decrease the current inventory stock.
