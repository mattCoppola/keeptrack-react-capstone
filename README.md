# keeptrack-react-capstone

## Project Description
This website is a basic tool for small businesses operating in the repair services industry.  The website is a repair order generator and basic inventory management system.  A user will be able to create a workorder, adding a summary of parts used for each repaired item on the order.  By adding parts to the order, once saved, it will decrease the current inventory stock.

## Development Roadmap
This is v1.0 of the app, with basic RESTful features, but future enhancements are expected to include:
* Registered users can add more than one Repaired Item and Repaired Parts
* Registered users can print completed work orders, so they can provide a formatted template to the customer.
* Registered users can update inventory counts
* Registered users can click on an inventory item in the inventory list to get a detailed view of the item (picture, description, cost, price).
* Registered users can view a metrics report on the dashboard.  This will show completed workorders by week, month, and quarter
